I'm ready to help you search and analyze your codebase. I can efficiently navigate through your project using glob patterns, regex searches, and file reading capabilities.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your werkflow project?

_**Agent (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) (sidechain)**_

I'm ready to assist with file search and code analysis tasks in the werkflow repository. I understand my role and constraints:

- I can ONLY read and explore existing code
- I cannot create, write, or modify any files
- I can use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for searching, and Read for specific files
- I can use Bash only for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)
- I must return absolute file paths in my final response
- I must follow the project's CLAUDE.md guidelines

The repository is at `/Users/lamteiwahlang/Projects/werkflow` and is a git project on the main branch.

What would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?
