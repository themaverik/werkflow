     * section (which contains graphic information like bounds and coordinates),
     * Flowable's DefaultProcessDiagramGenerator throws a NullPointerException when
     * trying to access GraphicInfo objects that don't exist.
     *
     * Solution:
     * This configuration disables automatic diagram generation during deployment.
     * Process definitions will still deploy successfully, and diagrams can be
     * generated on-demand later if proper graphic information is added to the BPMN files.
     *
